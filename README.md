# profiler.js

A utility class for instrumenting functions and collecting statistics such as the number of calls, the min/max duration, and the duration of each call. The class also tracks nested calls of instrumented functions, so if you instrument enough of your code, it can also be used as a tracer.

While not as accurate as some of the profilers built into desktop browsers, it is meant to be used as a tool for gathering information on mobile tools that lack performance/analysis tools. Nothing beats analyzing performance metrics generated on the actual device you are interested in since the same problems may not show up in the same code base when profiling on the desktop due to faster CPUs.
